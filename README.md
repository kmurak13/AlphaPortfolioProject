In this project, SQL queries were utilized to analyse a hypothetical motor vehicle business's data. 
The dataset is full of Tables to practise your SQL code. 
Queries were used to extract and analyse data including total sales by product, 
sales of a specific customer, 
as well as identifying the top-selling products with the highest gross margins and much more.
The Database file provided is the default dataset with no changes.
